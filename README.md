# Measure Energy Consumption on Various Network Conditions



For the present project we developed an android application to measure energy consumption given diferent network interfaces and
conditions (e.g 3G, LTE, Wifi etc). We extended an open source tool named Augemented Traffic Control (ATC)"reference", built by Facebook, in order to build an application that simulates various network
conditions and interfaces, parses battery statistics"reference" from android phones and records energy consumption after some event, e.g. play
an online video.
